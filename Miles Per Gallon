// S112 Kowata Miles Per Gallon.cpp 
// Author: Michael Kowata
/* "Goal: Solve the following problem
Miles per gallon
Write a program that calculates a cars gas milelage. The program should ask the user to enter 
the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank.
It should then display the number of miles that may be driven per gallon of gas.*/

//Preprcessor Declarations
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

//Global constants
//const double FULLTANK = 20; //gallons in a full tank

//Main Function
int main()
{
    //Variable Definition
    double gallons, distance, mpg;

    //Input
    cout << "Enter distance driven: ";
    cin >> distance;
    cout << "Enter max tank capacity: ";
    cin >> gallons;

    //Process
    mpg = distance / gallons;

    //Output
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    cout << "Performance (mile/gallons) is: " << mpg << endl;
}
